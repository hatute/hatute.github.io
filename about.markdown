---


I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University–New Brunswick. My research primarily focuses on Brain-Computer Interfaces, Brain-Inspired Computation, and Medical Imaging Informatics. I am passionate about exploring the intersection of neuroscience and engineering to develop innovative solutions that enhance human-computer interaction.

<!-- I am currently a doctoral candidate in Computer Science entering my third year at Rutgers University–New Brunswick. My primary research interests encompass Brain-Computer Interfaces, Brain-inspired computation, and Medical Imaging Informatics. At present, my research is focused on the temporal analysis of Electroencephalogram data and the development of algorithms driven by spiking neural networks. -->

<!-- I am a third-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Rutgers University–New Brunswick, supervised by Prof. [Konstantinos Michmizos](http://combra.cs.rutgers.edu/). My main research interests are Brain-inspired Computation & Medical Imaging Informatics. I have experience on few-shot learning problems in the medical field. And these days, I am working on real-time Electroencephalogram(EEG) data analysis and spiking neural networks(SNN). -->
