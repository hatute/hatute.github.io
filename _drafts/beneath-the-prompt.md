As of today, there is no doubt that the practical applications of various large language models (LLMs)—namely, AI chat assistants like Deepseek, ChatGPT, and Gemini—have already transformed the way we gather and interact with information. Have you ever felt torn? On one hand, these tools are astonishing; unlike Google Search, which matches keywords, they can actually understand our inputs to some degree and return plausible explanations, sometimes even demonstrating the ability to solve complex scientific problems. Yet on the other hand, you cannot fully rely on them. For elementary tasks like counting how many ‘r’s are in the word “strawberry,” they consistently deliver "defiant" yet laughably absurd answers. I need not elaborate further on the conveniences these tools bring us, but at the same time, certain underlying “side effects” have deeply concerned me, to the point where I believe practical constraints at the legal and educational levels require serious consideration and attention.
